Hey Dax!
<br><br>
I would like to sit down with you and talk about your goals and plans. When you moved in here from Mom's, one of the things I said I expected was for you to talk with me. "I don't know" can't be the default answer. If you don‚Äôt know something, like what you want to do right now, what you want to do in 5 years, what kind of job you want, what career you want to prepare for, should you go on a mission, etc., that‚Äôs ok. It's ok to not know, but I need you to not shut down with "I don't know" ‚Äì I want you to think through it, talk through it with me, and ‚Äúhelp me help you‚Äù figure out what you want in life and how to get there.
<br><br>
You probably haven‚Äôt seen this movie, but it‚Äôs funny üòä
<br><br>
 
What do YOU want?
<br><br>
Will you please take some time to write down some things that you want? That is important to me, and I want to help you with them.
<br><br>
Ideas:
-What kind of work do you want to do right now? It doesn't have to be permanent, but it does have to move you forwards. Towards what? Independence, career, family, legacy, goals, etc.
-What kind of work do you want to do five years from now? What do you need to learn before then in order to do that? What can you do now to work towards it?
-Do you want a family? What will you need in order to have and support a wife and family?
-You mentioned wanting to live in the country ‚Äì away from hustle and bustle and chaos. How will you make that goal / dream happen?
-Do you want to get out on your own? How long do you want to live with me (and/or Mom)?
-What is something you wish you knew, knew how to do, or was better at?
-What are some things you want to accomplish?
-What kind of activities / hobbies do you want to do?
-What place in the world would you most like to go to? And what would you want to do there? Who would you want to go with?
<br><br>
Also think about:
-What is holding you back from any of these things? What is getting in the way?
<br><br>
Please give these things some thought. I'd like to talk to you later this afternoon (4 ish) about it, so please give it some thought before then and write down as much as you can, and let me know if you need more time. We could talk about it later tonight too. 
<br><br>
You will be 20 this week, and I often feel like I haven‚Äôt been very helpful in helping you get to a place in life that you want to be. I‚Äôm sorry for that. I love and care for you, and I want all the good things in life for you. You can do it! You can literally do anything you want and will set your mind to. I believe in you. I know you can do it! You don‚Äôt have to do it alone ‚Äì me and Mom (and Kristin) would be happy to help ‚Äì it's part of our job and calling here, as well as something we want to do - we can't imagine much greater reward than helping our children do and become what they want, or whatever makes them happy. We just want you to find happiness and success.
<br><br>
I have some ideas and have had some inspirations I‚Äôd like to share with you, but I want to hear what YOU think and want.
<br><br>
Love, Dad
