                Hello! My name is Greg. I have recently transferred to Pathways / BYU-I from 
                Weber State University, pursuing a Software Engineering BS. This is my third 
                attempt at a degree. 25 years ago I started at Weber State, then life got busy 
                with bills, work, kids, etc. and I didn't finish. 15 years ago I attended Western 
                Governors University, then life happened again as I went through a divorce and 
                I didn't finish. I started back at Weber State a year and a half ago but then 
                decided to transfer to Pathways / BYU because we were struggling to keep up 
                with tuition, but it was still important to me to finish.
            </p>

                I remarried two years ago to a sweet girl named Kristin and moved to North Salt 
                Lake. Kristin has 5 kids - 18, 16, 14, 11, 9. Combined with my 5 kids - 22, 19, 
                17, 14, 9 - we make quite the gang lol Kristin is a school counselor at American 
                Preparatory Academy in Draper.

            <p>
                I am an Escalations Engineer for an IT consulting / outsourcing company based in 
                Utah called Executech. We provide IT services for organizations that either doesn't 
                need "full-time" IT staff or want to augment their IT teams with additional help and 
                expertise. For example, two of my clients are Davis County cities where I spend about 
                15 hours/wk, and I also spend 5 hours managing IT for a law firm  and for a capital 
                investment firm in SLC. I am also one of our technical instructors, currently teaching 
                server hardware, virtualization, DNS, and Active Directory / Group Policy. The rest of 
                the time I spend troubleshooting and fixing hardware/software and network issues 
                escalated to me by our technical teams.
            </p>
